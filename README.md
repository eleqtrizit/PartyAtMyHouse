# PartyAtMyHouse

## Origins of this Project

I wrote this project while taking an AngularJS class at Bitwise Industries in Fresno, CA.

I really don't recommend using this project for anything yourself, as it was written while I was a beginner in AngularJS.

However, it is functional, and if you wish to try it out, you can go to https://www.partyatmy.house and try it out.

## Bugs

The parties only last about an hour, as the Spotify Token expires and I never put in the code to renew it.  Part of the problem is the backend was written in old CGI Perl.  The other part of the problem is that I didn't need the party to last longer than an hour since I only had 10 minutes to demo my project to the class.  :)
