# PartyAtMyHouse

## Origins of this Project

I wrote this project while taking an AngularJS class at Bitwise Industries in Fresno, CA.

I really don't recommend using this project for anything yourself, as it was written while I was a beginner in AngularJS.

## Update

The program no longer works as it was not updated as Spotify APIs enolved.  

## Bugs

The parties only last about an hour, as the Spotify Token expires and I never put in the code to renew it.  Part of the problem is the backend was written in old CGI Perl.  The other part of the problem is that I didn't need the party to last longer than an hour since I only had 10 minutes to demo my project to the class.  :)

## Usage  

If you do want to use this, you will need to edit the $install_path variable to where you put the files, and you will need to go get a Spotify API key at https://beta.developer.spotify.com/ and edit that into the CGI files as well.
